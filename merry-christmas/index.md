Marcy.

I love you.

It's had to know what to get you. I wanted to get you something special.
Something that would make you feel special. But I'm not one for knick-nacks.

I wanted to get you something you would use. I hope that this is something
you will use. I bought you

You can use if for what ever you want. But I have a couple ideas to get you
started.

You could:
 * post a professional resume here
 * set up a mail account (like marcy@marcyminchin.com)
 * put your blog here, or on a subdomain (like blog.marcyminchin.com)
 * setup a forward to different online services. For example, have facebook.marcyminchin.com forward to http://www.facebook.com/marcy.andersonminchin. You could do the same with YouTube, Twitter, etc.
 * put up a photo album
 * set up a "start page" - this can be the page that shows up when you start your web browser and has a link to all the sites you regularly visit
 * setup a "personal landing page", almost like an online business card. Basically this has your name, a cool pictures, a links to things like your Twitter and your Facebook. Some examples
   * <http://www.daniel-moreira.com/> <!-- Flavors.me -->
   * <http://rebeccaweeks.com/>

 * what ever else you can dream of!
 
But wait, [there's more](http://minchin.ca/marcy/theres-more)!
