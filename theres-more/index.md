That's right. There's more. Remember when I asked you if I could take you shopping in
Utah? We'll here's what I had in mind:

![Diamond Earings](diamond_earings.jpg)
![Diamond Necklace](diamond_necklaces.jpg)

I'm not sure what exactly to get, but I love the sparkle of diamonds, especially on you!
So I'd like to get you a necklace, or earings if we can find some nice clip-ons.
This is what I'd thought to spend most of my Christmas money on you on.

They say jewery is cheaper in Utah and this way I get to pick something out with you.

Marcy, honey, I love you!!
